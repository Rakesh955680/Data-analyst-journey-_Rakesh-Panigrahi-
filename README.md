"📈 From Numbers to Narratives – My Data Story"

👋 Hi there, I’m Rakesh — welcome to my world of data!

It all started with a simple curiosity: “What hidden patterns live inside everyday data?”
That one question sparked a journey where raw numbers slowly turned into stories that inspire, strategies that work, and decisions that matter.

Over time, this curiosity grew into a passion — a passion for uncovering insights that truly drive business impact.

🔍 What I Do

Today, I work as a Data Analyst, bridging the gap between raw data and business decisions.
My toolkit helps me bring clarity out of complexity:

🛠 Data Wrangling & Storytelling with Python, SQL & Excel

📊 Interactive Dashboards using Power BI & Tableau

📈 Business Insights across Retail, Hospitality & HR Analytics

From optimizing pricing models to streamlining supply chains or automating reports, I love the challenge of transforming messy datasets into actionable, memorable visuals.
